# Get Authorized Payment

Shows details for an authorized payment, by ID.

```csharp
GetAuthorizedPaymentAsync(
    Models.GetAuthorizedPaymentInput input)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `authorizationId` | `string` | Template, Required | The ID of the authorized payment for which to show details. |
| `paypalMockResponse` | `string` | Header, Optional | PayPal's REST API uses a request header to invoke negative testing in the sandbox. This header configures the sandbox into a negative testing state for transactions that include the merchant. |
| `paypalAuthAssertion` | `string` | Header, Optional | An API-caller-provided JSON Web Token (JWT) assertion that identifies the merchant. For details, see [PayPal-Auth-Assertion](/docs/api/reference/api-requests/#paypal-auth-assertion).

## Response Type

This method returns an [`ApiResponse`](../../doc/api-response.md) instance. The `Data` property of this instance returns the response data which is of type [Models.PaymentAuthorization](../../doc/models/payment-authorization.md).

# Reauthorize Payment

Reauthorizes an authorized PayPal account payment, by ID. To ensure that funds are still available, reauthorize a payment after its initial three-day honor period expires. Within the 29-day authorization period, you can issue multiple re-authorizations after the honor period expires. If 30 days have transpired since the date of the original authorization, you must create an authorized payment instead of reauthorizing the original authorized payment. A reauthorized payment itself has a new honor period of three days. You can reauthorize an authorized payment from 4 to 29 days after the 3-day honor period. The allowed amount depends on context and geography, for example in US it is up to 115% of the original authorized amount, not to exceed an increase of $75 USD. Supports only the `amount` request parameter. Note: This request is currently not supported for Partner use cases.

ReauthorizePaymentAsync(
    Models.ReauthorizePaymentInput input)

In countries where SCA has been defined and implemented it will result in a contingency and HATEOAS link being returned.  The API caller should redirect the payer to that link so that they can authenticate themselves against their issuing bank or other entity. As noted, the HATEOAS link is only available in all regions where strong authentication is supported, (e.g. in European countries where 3DS is live). Merchants can use this setting as an additional layer of security if they choose to. In all cases, when an authorization is requested the AVS/CVV results will be returned in the response.
